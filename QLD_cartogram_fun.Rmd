This fine Easter Monday, I decided to make a cartogram of Queensland. Cartograms are maps where area is transformed according to some other variable. In this case, my variable of interest is population. Basically, I'm creating a map of Queensland where the size of Lower Government Areas (LGAs) have been transformed according to the area's population.

I'm following this excellent [R Bloggers tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/cartograms-with-r/).

## The data

Mapping data for Queensland LGAs can be downloaded from the [Queensland Government Data website](https://data.qld.gov.au/dataset/local-government-area-boundaries-queensland). The dataset can be downloaded in a variety of file formats and projections. Downloading the data is pretty straightforward, you just go to the link above and click through to the dataset. In this case, I selected Shapefile (.shp) format and the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection. You have to enter your email address, after which you'll receive an email with a link to a zip file attachment.
